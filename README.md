# mnist_iforest
data cleaning and work around isolation forest

### Summary

This project deals with outlier detection using isolation forest. The project mainly focuses on using Go for isolation forest outlier detection. Both Python and R are used as benchmarks to compare the correlation for each method. The three methods that produced the best results are listed below:
1. Python and scikit-learn
2. R using isotree
3. Go using i-forest (https://github.com/e-XpertSolutions/go-iforest/tree/master)
